        Hello, my name is Pedro Sousa, I am 21 years old and currently a Computer Science student at the Federal Institute of Brasília. Throughout my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to dive into the fascinating world of Front-End and Back-End development, and from the very first contact, I fell in love with these technologies.

    I am currently working with cutting-edge tools such as Laravel, Spring Boot, Angular, and Vue.js, always striving for excellence in every project. Additionally, I am familiar with Git/GitHub and Docker, and I possess knowledge of SQL databases. My experience also extends to office tools like Word and Excel, where I maintain a high standard of organization.

    I excel in using agile methodologies, especially Kanban, which I apply to ensure efficiency and quality in my work. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to enhance my skills and make a significant contribution to innovative projects.
